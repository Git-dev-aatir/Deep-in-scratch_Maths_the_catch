# LICENSE

**The "Please Don't Sue Me And Just Copy This Code Wherever You Want" Public License**  
*Version 0.42 (Because obviously)*

## üìú Preamble

Congratulations! You've stumbled upon this neural network library, probably while procrastinating on your actual work or trying to avoid reading yet another 47-page Apache license that nobody really understands anyway. 

This license exists because my friend lawyer (not yet a lawyer) has convinced the world that sharing code requires more paperwork than buying a house. Since we apparently live in a reality where "just use my code" isn't legally sufficient, here we are.

## üé≠ Terms and Conditions

### Article I: The "Do Whatever" Clause
You are hereby granted permission to:
- Copy this software (shocking, I know)
- Modify it (please do, it probably needs it)
- Distribute it (spread the chaos)
- Use it commercially (make that money, honey)
- Sublicense it (because why not add more lawyers?)

**BUT** (because there's always a but)...

### Article II: The "Don't Be That Person" Requirements

If you use this software, you solemnly swear to:

1. **Not claim you wrote it** - Your GitHub contribution graph is depressing enough without lies (still not depressing than mine).
2. **Give credit where due** - A simple "based on the work by [Me]" won't kill you.
3. **Not use it for evil** - This includes but is not limited to:
   - Creating AI that judges people for their Spotify playlists
   - Building recommendation systems that only suggest pineapple pizza
   - Training models to write passive-aggressive code comments
   - Any neural network designed to explain why cryptocurrency is the future or how JavaScript is the best language (it's shit, but necessary shit)

### Article III: The "Expectation Management" Section

This software is provided "AS IS" - which is legal speak for:
- It might work
- It might not work  
- It might achieve consciousness and judge your life choices
- The author is definitely not responsible if your neural network becomes sentient and starts a robot uprising

### Article IV: The "Karma Clause" (Optional but Encouraged)

If this software proves useful, the author humbly requests one of the following:
- A brief moment of gratitude while you curse this code at 3 AM
- A GitHub star (it's free and makes developers feel validated)
- A positive mention in your project's README (fame is the currency of open source)
- A pull request fixing that thing you noticed but were too polite to mention

### Article V: The "Fine Print" That's Actually Readable

- This license applies to all files in this repository unless specifically noted otherwise
- If any part of this license is deemed unenforceable, the rest still applies (legal redundancy!)
- This license is compatible with your sanity (unlike some others)
- The version number is intentionally ridiculous and will remain so (probably)

## ü§ù Warranty Disclaimer

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. The author makes no promises about:
- Performance (it's neural networks, not magic)
- Accuracy (garbage in, garbage out)
- Your job security if this breaks in production
- The meaning of life, the universe, or why neural networks work at all

## üèõÔ∏è Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHOR BE LIABLE FOR:
- Direct damages (the obvious stuff)
- Indirect damages (the sneaky stuff)
- Consequential damages (the butterfly effect stuff)
- Your boss finding out you copied this from GitHub
- Existential crises caused by contemplating artificial intelligence
- Time lost debugging gradient descent

## üìû Contact

For questions about this license, please:
1. Read it again (seriously, it's not that long)
2. Check the FAQ (if one exists, which probably doesn't right now)
3. Google or ChatGPT it (you were going to anyway)
4. File an issue (but be nice about it)
5. Accept that some things in life don't have answers

**Remember**: This license is meant to protect both of us while keeping things simple. Be excellent to each other, and may your gradients always converge.

*¬© 2025 - Licensed under the "Please Don't Sue Me And Just Copy This Code Wherever You Want" Public License v0.42*

**P.S.** If you actually read this entire license, you deserve a cookie üç™. Most people just scroll to the bottom anyway.

**P.P.S.** I hope version 0.42 finally leads me to ‚Äúthe Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything‚Äù, because after making this repository I know for certain that making it was surely not the answer to properly utilizing my vacation (but it was still fun).
